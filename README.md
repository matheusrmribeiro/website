# Website

My personal website hosted on Github Pages.

## About

This project is structured with **Clean Architecture** and **MVVM** using _ChangeNotifier_ for State Management.

> I have used classes extended from _ChangeNotifier_ as _ViewModels_.

I'm using the free GitHub API to fetch my projects to show them on the website.<br>
For now, the project is not responsive, so it will only work well when open as a Desktop website.
